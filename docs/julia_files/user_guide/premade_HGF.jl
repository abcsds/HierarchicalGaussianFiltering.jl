# ![continuous 2-level graph](../images/HGF_structures/categorical.svg)


# The categorical 3-level HGF model takes an input from one of m categories and learns the probability of a category appearing.

# - input node: categorical
# - state nodes:
#   - 1st level: categorical (value coupling to input node)
#   - 2nd level: m binary (all value couplings to 1st level)
#   - 3rd level: continuous (shared volatility coupling to all m nodes in 2nd level)

# ## Categorical 3-level state transition HGF

# The categorical 3-level HGF model learns state transition probabilities between a set of categorical states.

# - input node: categorical input nodes
# - state nodes:
#   - 1st level: categorical state nodes (value coupling to input node)
#   - 2nd level: binary state nodes for each categorical state node (value coupling from each categorical state node to binary state nodes)
#   - 3rd level: continous (volatility coupling to all nodes in 2nd level)
